Below is a screenshot of the logic analyzer code attached in this folder. It records whats being sent on pins 22 and 23 which are the SDA and SCL lines respectively. One chip was running the logic analyzer code while connected to the APDS sensor which was then connected to another chip running the lab 1 python code.
