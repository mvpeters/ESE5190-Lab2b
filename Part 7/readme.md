Below is a video of the chip recording and replaying a sequence of button presses this time using the PIO module. The code is very similar to part 3, it records for 10 seconds then replays it indefinetly. However the difference is this uses the PIO module. The code was created by editing the logic analyzer example and trying to combine it with my original looping part 3 code.
