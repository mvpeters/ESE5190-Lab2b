# ESE5190-Lab2b

**As of Wednesday 11/16**

I'm only submitting what I have for now on time which is parts 1, 2, 5, & 10. I'm still working through some of the others and will use my 1 latepass on the remaining parts of this lab. 


**As of Thursday 12/8**

I added the remaining parts (Parts 3,4,6,7,8,9) that I still needed and any additional videos or screenshots I forgot to add previously.


**Answers to the questions from Canvas**

**Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? Be specific, and quote any parts of the lab description relevant to your answer (e.g., "modify the PIO/DMA logic analyzer example to record a timestamped trace of an RP2040-ADPS9960 exchange while the BOOT button is pressed.") I will make particular notice of anything that seems underspecified (e.g., words whose meaning is not clear from context, or conflicting interpretations of a deliverable).**


The most confusing part was probably part 9. The guide mentions to view lab timings of packets being sent between the sensor and the chip however it was called lab on a chip and looking at other students demo videos most I saw didnâ€™t have any timing information and instead implemented the lab 1 firefly but in C. This is what I ended up doing 


**Which lab topics have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? E.g., "serial communication with Python," "aliased bitwise operations," "programming the PIO," etc. Be specific, and describe any lingering areas of confusion and/or anything that has helped you navigate them.**


I think just in general more specific instructions would have been very beneficial. For example in part 3 you suggested using the python serial library to record the log and save it to CSV. Just that little note was very helpful guidance and helped me figure out that part. The previous two labs had very detailed write ups with suggestions about how to accomplish each task and the order to go in so adding those to these could help future students.


**Which parts of the lab have you found most difficult to implement? Again, be specific, citing any parts of the lab materials & your own code that are relevant to your answer.**


The hardest parts were definitely parts 4, and 7. I understood what to do just more details about the steps and order to go in would have been helpful. 


**What steps have you taken to resolve these difficulties? Any other barriers you have faced to completing this assignment? Mention any students, repos, or other resources you have found helpful in completing the lab so far.**


Most of the difficulties I faced I had to either look online to see how others did similar actions or look at other students submitted code and try to adapt their strategies to my sequencer code. Also looking at other peoples videos and demos was very useful to see what they got working and what the ultimate goal looks like. Sometimes just the description isnt enough for me to fully understand what you're looking for as a deliverable since I am new to C and embedded systems.
