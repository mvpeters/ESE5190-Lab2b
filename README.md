# ESE5190-Lab2b

**As of Wednesday 11/16**

I'm only submitting what I have for now on time which is parts 1, 2, 5, & 10. I'm still working through some of the others and will use my 1 latepass on the remaining parts of this lab. 


**As of Thursday 12/8**

I added the remaining parts that I still needed and any additional videos or screenshots I forgot to add previously.


**Answers to the questions from Canvas**
**Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? Be specific, and quote any parts of the lab description relevant to your answer (e.g., "modify the PIO/DMA logic analyzer example to record a timestamped trace of an RP2040-ADPS9960 exchange while the BOOT button is pressed.") I will make particular notice of anything that seems underspecified (e.g., words whose meaning is not clear from context, or conflicting interpretations of a deliverable).**




**Which lab topics have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? E.g., "serial communication with Python," "aliased bitwise operations," "programming the PIO," etc. Be specific, and describe any lingering areas of confusion and/or anything that has helped you navigate them.**



**Which parts of the lab have you found most difficult to implement? Again, be specific, citing any parts of the lab materials & your own code that are relevant to your answer.**




**What steps have you taken to resolve these difficulties? Any other barriers you have faced to completing this assignment? Mention any students, repos, or other resources you have found helpful in completing the lab so far.**
