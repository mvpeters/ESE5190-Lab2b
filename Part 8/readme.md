Below is a video of the APDS sensor connected using C. It reads the proximity value from 0-255 and outputs the 4 color readings: red, green, blue, clear. For the video I brought a green LED close to it to show the green value spiking and the other values raising as the brightness around increased. For the proximity I just moved my hand closer to the sensor to show the functionality.
